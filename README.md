# QSAR

This is a QSAR based approach to predict if a given compound will be metabolized by the liver (Cytochrome P450) or not

## Datasets

There are 2 datasets used in this project 

### 1 . DrugBank
available at [DrugBank](https://go.drugbank.com/](https://go.drugbank.com/releases/latest )

You will need an academic license to use this dataset

The version of the dataset used for this dataset is 5.1.13	

### 2. ChEMBL
available at [ChEMBL](https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/chembl/ChEMBLdb/latest/)
The version of the dataset used for this dataset is `chembl_35.db`

### AdmetLab 3.0 Calculation

ADmetlab3.0 was used to get CYP450 isoform metabolite scores and this was done by submitting the smiles values 500 at a time. This task was done manually and for the ease of seeing the results , I have done the extraction and all the values are present in the directory `clean_smiles_bacth_values_admet_3`. 

### Running the project 

1. install the requriemts as per the requriemts.txt
2. Run Code_1A.ipynb until you the mark down that says `save the dataset`  (extract all compounds from DrugBank)
3. Run the full ChEMBL_dataset_extraction.ipynb
4. Run the remaining of Code_1A.ipynb 

This project aimed to answer the following research questions 

1. How do different sampling (class weights, oversampling, undersampling) techniques
affect the performance of Random Forest Models?
2. How do different decision tree (LightGBM, Random Forest, XGBoost) algorithms
compare against each other?
3. Does incorporating different molecular fingerprints (Morgan, MACCS, Daylight-like)
help boost the modelâ€™s predictability?
4. Do metabolite scores obtained from ADMET analysis significantly enhance predictive
performance?
5. Does incorporating a silver-standard dataset, specifically ChEMBL, improve the pre-
dictive performance of the model
